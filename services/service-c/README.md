One of (8) Go-based, RESTful microservices, which make up this reference distributed system platform, designed to generate service-to-service, service-to-database (MongoDB), and service-to-queue-to-service (RabbitMQ) IPC (inter-process communication). Refer to the post, [Kubernetes-based Microservice Observability with Istio Service Mesh: Part 1](https://wp.me/p1RD28-6fL) and the GitHub project, [k8s-istio-observe-backend](https://github.com/garystafford/k8s-istio-observe-backend) for more information.
